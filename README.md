# RoadColors
Plot roads in a US city, coloring each by its designation (e.g. Street, Road, Avenue)

Before you get started, you’ll need to get a few things prepared:

1. Find the lat/long point you’d like to be at the center of your map
2. Identify the GEOIDs of counties that are within 15 miles of this point. This site is very helpful: https://census.missouri.edu/geocodes/
3. Download roads shapefiles for the counties in step 2: ftp://ftp2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2018/ROADS/
4. Download feature names shapefiles for the counties in step 2: https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2018/FEATNAMES/
